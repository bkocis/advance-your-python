### Examples of some concepts in python, and other python handy-dandys
___

This repo is written in a style of a book, where code examples are given in a very pragmatic and simplistic manner. 
The aim of this presentation is to offer a catalogue of examples of some of the most important concepts in python, and other python handy-dandys.
It is not meant to be a complete reference, but rather a quick reference for those who are already familiar with the basics of python.
The audience of this book is assumed to be for fellow data scientist, who are looking for a quick reference to some of the more advanced concepts in python gathered at one place, and in short.
