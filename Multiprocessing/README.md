### Which is better to apply in python: multiprocessing or multi-threading?

The choice between using multiprocessing or multithreading in Python depends on the specific task at hand and the characteristics of your hardware.

In general, multiprocessing is better suited for CPU-bound tasks, where the primary bottleneck is the CPU's processing power. It can take advantage of multiple cores in your machine, allowing for parallel processing of different parts of the task, which can significantly speed up the execution time.

On the other hand, multithreading is better suited for I/O-bound tasks, where the primary bottleneck is waiting for input/output operations to complete, such as reading or writing files, accessing a network, or interacting with a database. In these cases, using threads can allow for better use of the CPU while waiting for I/O operations to complete.

It's also important to note that due to the global interpreter lock (GIL) in Python, multithreading may not provide as much of a performance boost as multiprocessing, especially for CPU-bound tasks. The GIL restricts the execution of multiple threads simultaneously, so only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time. However, this limitation does not apply to multiprocessing, as each process has its own interpreter and memory space.

Overall, the best approach depends on the specific problem you're trying to solve and the characteristics of your hardware. As a rule of thumb, if your task involves heavy CPU usage, go for multiprocessing. If it involves mostly I/O operations, multithreading may be more suitable.
